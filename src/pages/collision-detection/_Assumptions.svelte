<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All of the shapes in the physics simulation will be convex.</p>
    <i>
      This is the most important assumption because, as I will later go in to,
      the Separating Axis Theorem requires that both shapes are convex to
      accurately determine whether or not a collision has occured.
